# Reflection

### 1. How exactly did you use AI while building this?
#### Tools Used:
- ChatGPT (GPT-4o) for full-stack scaffolding, API logic, HTML UX, debugging, and prompt driven iteration.
#### Prompts included:
- "Build me a FastAPI endpoint for slot suggestion"
- "edit the given code with much more logical efficiency"
- "Refactor this HTML to remove Submit and make Book smarter"
- "Make the UI  usable"
#### successes:
- Cut dev time by 70% while polishing frontend logic.
- Got clean backend API logic in one go.
#### Failures:
- Sometimes generated unnecessary extras (like keeping the Submit button after removing logic).
- Needed to guide AI to stick strictly to spec wording.


### 2.If given two more days, what would you refactor or add first, and why?
Planned Next:
- Calendar visualization for each user (GET /calendar/{id} â†’ frontend).
- Duration input dropdown for customizable meeting lengths.
- A backend data store (e.g., SQLite) to persist slots beyond app restart.

These improve usability, realism and data persistence, making it more production grade.
